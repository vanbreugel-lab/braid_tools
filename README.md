# braid_tools
helpful nodes for ros/braid interfacing

# braid_ros_listener.py
Node that listens to an active Braid instance and streams the data into a ros node

# braid_emulator.py
Simulates a moving trajectory and outputs in the same format as the braid_ros_listener.  Helpful for testing hardware without needing real trajectory data

# braid_realtime_plotter.py
Allows you to visualizer where in space tracked objects are.  Helpful for trouble shooting orientations of calibrations and testing tracking.
