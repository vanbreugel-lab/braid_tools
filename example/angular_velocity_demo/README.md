# Example data with angular velocity calculations

The hdf file included here was generated by running the preprocessing script included in this directory on a raw braidz file. The proprocessing script does some minimal filtering of trajectories, and calculates angular velocity a variety of ways. The notebook visualizes the angular velocity.
